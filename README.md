Welcome to the Flappy Bird game, implemented in Python using the Pygame library. Relive the classic fun of Flappy Bird on your desktop! Ultimately, I aim to implement AI algorithms to play the game and achieve high scores autonomously.

## How to Play
- **Spacebar**: Make the bird flap its wings to gain altitude.
- **Avoid Pipes**: Navigate through the gaps between pipes.
- **Score Points**: Earn points for each set of pipes you successfully pass.

## AI Integration

One of the exciting future directions for this project is to develop an AI that can play Flappy Bird autonomously. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to train a model that can achieve high scores by learning from the gameplay data.
